h1. mustachio

Put a mustache on some JSON. "Salvador Dal√≠ would be proud":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Salvador_Dali_NYWTS.jpg.

h2. Reasoning

Mustache.js is great, but sometimes you can't quite tell why your template isn't working with the JSON you're getting. Often times, what you really wish you had is a handy way to edit both the JSON and the template, side-by-side, and see the result. That's what mustachio does for you.
